# Medical Image Enhancement for Radiology

This project is a MATLAB-based **image processing tool** designed to enhance the clarity and quality of medical radiology images. The tool includes a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** that allows users to apply a variety of enhancement techniques, such as noise reduction, contrast improvement, and segmentation, to aid in medical diagnosis.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Gaussian Filtering**: Reduces noise while preserving image details.
- **Histogram Equalization**: Enhances contrast for better visibility.
- **Sharpening**: Highlights fine details like small lesions.
- **Edge Detection**: Identifies boundaries, such as tumors or organs.
- **Inversion**: Creates a negative image for alternative analysis.
- **Semantic Segmentation**: Divides the image into distinct regions using the **active contour algorithm** (also known as snakes) to isolate areas of interest, such as abnormal growths or lesions.

## ðŸ“‹ Workflow
1. **Input**: Users can choose from pre-loaded images or upload their own.
2. **Processing**:
   - Select enhancement techniques (Gaussian, Histogram Equalization, Sharpening).
   - Apply advanced processing (Edge Detection, Inversion, Segmentation using active contour).
3. **Output**: View processed images alongside histograms for analysis.
